# Test log

One row per test run, newest first. Never delete rows.
Before running a test, check here: if the same test already passed at a commit and `git log <sha>..HEAD`
shows no change to the code it covers, do not run it again.

- Mock = mock models, US$0. Paid = real provider, cost noted.
- Ports: isolated backends on 8871/8872 only.

| 2026-11-04 | chore/demo-integrate-main-1104 @ cf5db59 | Merged the teammate's 7th branch `feature/recent-searches-ui` (Find ideas recent-searches table): `tsc -b` + build, eslint, `bash bin/verify.sh` | GREEN. Not browser-tested (no E2E covers Find ideas recent searches) | Mock | PR #49 |
| 2026-11-04 | chore/demo-integrate-main-1104 @ 20aad0d (+ e2e/lib.cjs wait fix) | After restoring the Canvas entries on the teammate's plan page / Plans cards: E2E polish A-D on 8872, each on a fresh backend; `bash bin/verify.sh` | B 76/76, C 50/50, D 54/54, A 17/18 (only the known h1, issue #9; ran with `h1, h2`), verify GREEN. First run B-D failed: after the teammate's login change the app's first library save landed after `seed()` and wiped it; fixed in `e2e/lib.cjs` login (wait for network idle) | Mock | scratchpad `e2e-20aad0d/` (not kept) |
| 2026-11-04 | chore/demo-integrate-main-1104 @ 78c1331 | After merging the teammate's 6 branches (entry-screens-ui, find-ideas-first-visit, landing-demo-search, plan-page-polish, planning-board-navy, plans-card-trim): `bash bin/verify.sh`, `tsc -b`, eslint, build | GREEN, 0 errors. Browser E2E not re-run. Note: plan-page-polish and plans-card-trim removed the Plan page / Plans card entries into the Canvas and the production + publish panel (CutPanel); only the sidebar Canvas item remains | Mock | PR #49 |
